 * one past the highest card type value.
 *<P>
 * If you add values here, be sure to update javadocs at
 * server.giveDevCard,  .handleGAMETEXTMSG and .sendGameStateOVER ,
 * and handpanel.updateDevCards .
 * If you add VP card types, update {@link SOCDevCardSet#isVPCard(int)}.
 *<P>
 * In version 2.0.00, the values for {@link #KNIGHT} and {@link #UNKNOWN}
 * were swapped to make room for new card types.  For compatibility with
 * older versions, constants {@link #KNIGHT_FOR_VERS_1_X} and
 * {@link #UNKNOWN_FOR_VERS_1_X} were added.  See {@link #VERSION_FOR_NEW_TYPES}.
